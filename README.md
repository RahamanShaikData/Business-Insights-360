**Note:**  
This repository showcases my **Power BI project** through screenshots of the dashboards, charts, and visualizations.  

The original `.pbix` file contains high-resolution images, multiple views, and detailed charts, which made the file size too large to upload directly to GitHub. To ensure accessibility, I have provided screenshots demonstrating the key insights, data analysis, and interactive design of the project.
